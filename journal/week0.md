# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Bootcamp Overview

Margaret Valtierra, an AWS Community Hero, went over the business use case of our project.

Chris Williams, an AWS Community Hero, went through the Well-Architected tool on AWS Management Console. He also encouraged us to ask "dumb" questions if we were unsure of any requirements. Chris talked about how important Requirements, Risks, Constraints and Assumptions were to architecture.

Requirements must be verifiable, monitorable and feasible.

Risks could include user commitment and Late Delivery.

Some assumptions are; Budget is approved, Stakeholders will be available to make decisions and there will be sufficient network bandwidth.

Constraints could include time and budget.

He also categorised stakeholder expectation to project delivery to 3 categories; fast, cheap or good.

The architecture is usally divided into Conceptual Design, Logical Design and Physical Design. Lucid chart was used to create the logical design.

Andrew Brown asked if we could create a conceptual diagram on a napkin.


## Additional Youtube Videos

Andrew Brown created a youtube video on how to launch AWS CloudShell, Generate AWS credentials, Setting up AWS Budgets and Billing Alarms.

Chirag did a youtube video on Spend Considerations.

Ashish did one on Security Considerations.

# Week 10 & 11 â€” CloudFormation Part 1 & Part 2



## CFN Diagramming the Network Layer

I used Lucid Chart for the diagram.

In order to get this working, I had to make 2 amendments on the File -> Page Settings as follows:

- Page -> Page Settings -> Canvas -> Ticked the box for Infinite canvas

- Page -> Page Settings -> Line settings -> Ticked the box for Show line jumps

I made a few changes to rectangle as follows:

-	Got rid of rounding in rectangles by choosing a rectangle shape from the Flowchart.
  
   Clicked on Shape Options -> Amended ROUNDED to 0 px
   
-	Right clicked on the Rectangle -> Arrange -> Send to Back

- Used the line colour of #b0084d to highlight the rectangle borders and CruddurStack & CruddurNetworking

- Got rid of padding by clicking on Text Options -> amending PADDING to 0cm

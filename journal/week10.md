### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS.

When you use AWS CloudFormation, you work with templates and stacks. You create templates to describe your AWS resources and their properties. Whenever you create a stack, CloudFormation provisions the resources that are described in your template.

### Creating CloudFormation Stack <a name="paragraph1"></a>

Create a folder within aws called cfn. Then, create a file called template.yaml with the command below:

```sh
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Description: |
  Setup ECS Cluster
Resources:
  ECSCluster:
     Type: 'AWS::ECS::Cluster'
```

Create a folder within bin called cfn. Then, create a file called networking-deploy.

```sh
#! /usr/bin/env bash

set -e # stop the execution of the script if it fails
	

CFN_PATH="/workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/aws/cfn/template.yaml"

aws cloudformation deploy \
  --stack-name "my-cluster" \
  --template-file "$CFN_PATH" \
  --no-execute-changeset \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

### CFN Diagramming the Network Layer <a name="paragraph3"></a>

I used Lucid Chart for the diagram.

In order to get this working, I had to make 2 amendments on the File -> Page Settings as follows:

- Page -> Page Settings -> Canvas -> Ticked the box for Infinite canvas

- Page -> Page Settings -> Line settings -> Ticked the box for Show line jumps

I made a few changes to rectangle as follows:

-	Got rid of rounding in rectangles by choosing a rectangle shape from the Flowchart. Clicked on **Shape Options** -> Amended **ROUNDED** to 0 px
   
-	Right clicked on the Rectangle -> **Arrange** -> **Send to Back**

- Used the line colour of **#b0084d** to highlight the rectangle borders and CruddurStack & CruddurNetworking

- Got rid of padding by clicking on **Text Options** -> amended **PADDING** to 0cm


Please find below the screenshot of my CFN Diagramming the Network Layer:

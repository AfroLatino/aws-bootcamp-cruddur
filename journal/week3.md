## Required Homework 

### AWS Cognito Custom Pages

AWS Cognito lets you easily add user sign-up and authentication to your mobile and web apps. 

Install AWS Amplify is needed for authentication.

```sh
npm i aws-amplify --save
```
The following pages need to be amended:
```App.js```
```HomeFeedPage.js```
```ProfileInfo.js```


I created a user pool called crudder-user-pool and a user called afrolatino as seen below:

I was able to sign in to the web app using this user.

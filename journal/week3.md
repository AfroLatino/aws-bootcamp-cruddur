# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

## Required Homework 

### AWS Cognito Custom Pages

AWS Cognito lets you easily add user sign-up and authentication to your mobile and web apps. 

Install AWS Amplify is needed for authentication.

```sh
npm i aws-amplify --save
```
The following pages need to be amended to include the aws-amplify, const resend_code and const onsubmit codes:

```App.js```

```HomeFeedPage.js```

```ProfileInfo.js```

```SigninPage.js```

```SignupPage.js```

```ConfirmationPage.js```

```RecoverPage.js```


I created a user group called crudder-user-pool and a user called afrolatino as seen below:

During the livestream, we were unable to confirm the user created.

The command for user confirmation is as follows:

```sh
aws cognito-idp admin-set-user-password \
      --user-pool-id <your-user-pool-id> \
      --username <username> \
      --password <password> \
      --permanent
```

I was able to sign in to the web app using this user.

The handle also displayed the name and preferred username as seen below:

The HomeFeedPage displays the **session, attributes, client, pool, signInUserSession, storage** as seen below:

### Verify JWT Token server side to serve authenticated API endpoints in Flask Application

I was able to authenticate myself following the instructions on the video as seen below:

I was able to view the additional message in the codes visible only to authenticated users by Lore, **My dear brother, it is the humans that are the problem.**

### Improving UI Contrast & Implementing CSS Variables for Theming

Variables were set in Index.css page as follows:

```sh
:root {
  --bg: rgb(61,13,123);
  --fg: rgb(8,1,14);

  --field-border: rgb(255,255,255,0.29);
  --field-border-focus: rgb(149,0,255,1);
  --field-bg: rgb(31,31,31);
}
```

Several pages like ProfileInfo.css and DesktopNavigation.css were amended to improve the UI contrast.
